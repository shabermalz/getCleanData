Steps of the analysis:

1. Before importing the data the code creats variables with
- activity labels to later label the activity variable
- a list of the features to later label all feature variables
- a list of all features that are means or standard deviations
2. After the data is downloaded and labeled a training and a test data frame are created
3. The training and test data frames are merged into one file called 'part3'
4. The data is then grouped by subject and activity
5. Means of the grouped variables are calculated and combined in the final data frame
6. The tidy data frame is written to a text file called 'final.txt'
